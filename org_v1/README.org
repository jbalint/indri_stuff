Org-Mode Indexing & Retrieval

* Indexing
** TREC Format
   Org-mode files will be exported to TREC format for indexing
*** Date-oriented format
	Many files are organized by date. One example is work-log files.
	+ Top-level headings are date entries
	  + These should be considered "documents"
*** General format
*** Meta-data
	+ Filename (full path for now)
*** Limitations/issues
	+ Would be convenient to have line numbers or headings to refer back to
* Searching
** Basic search
